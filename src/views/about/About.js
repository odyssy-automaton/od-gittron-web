            The people of Earth have built a decentralized
            autonomous bot factory called Gittron and sent it out to explore the
            vastness of space. To expand its reach into the farthest edge of the
            cosmos, it builds self-replicating Prime Bots capable of cloning
            themselves as Buidl and Support Bots. Together, they buidl the crap

            The main purpose of Gittron is a gamified funding mechanism that
            adds passive income to support the further development of
            open-source projects. By supporting a verified Prime Bot on Gittron,
            you're sending funds directly to the project and receiving a Support
            Bot NFT as a thank you. The Gittron framework and its gamified
            funding mechanism could be applied to other kinds of impact
            projects. We do think taking a repo of code and generating
            programatic dna off of that is pretty cool though, but any data source
            could be used.

            <strong>How do I generate a Prime Bot?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Authenticate with a Web3 Wallet and go to Dashboard. In your
            Dashboard, you can register a new repo which will generate a Prime
            Bot. The repo must be set to public (no centralized repos allowed!).
            Set a price for how much you want to accept per 'Support' and a
            Wallet Address to receive the funds. Supporters will get a clone of
            your Prime Bot with some unique modifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>My Prime Bot has Supports. How do I withdraw?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Go to your Prime Bot's page, and at the bottom click the 'Withdraw'
            button. All funds in the Bot Bank will go to the address you set
            during generation of your Prime Bot. 20% will go to Gittron to
            support further development of the framework. This is also to
            disincentivize Prime Bots from supporting themselves, as they won't
            be able to get all the funds.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How do I get a Buidl Bot?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The owner of a Prime Bot can gift you a Buidl Bot if they haven't
            used them all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How do I get a Support Bot?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Click on a Prime Bot and on its page, you'll be able to 'Support'
            the Prime Bot with some ETH. When the transaction completes, you'll
            get a unique Support Bot.
          </p>
          <p> <strong>
            How do I show the universe how many Support Bots have been cloned from my Prime Bot?
          </strong> </p>
          <p>
            Copy the below HTML snippet into your Github repo's readme and replace "MyBotId" with your Prime Bot ID (the "0x..." section  of the "gittron.me/bots/0x...." URL that is your Prime Bot profile page)
            <pre><code>
            &lt;a href="https://gittron.me/bots/MyBotID">
            &lt;img src="https://badgen.net/https/data.gittron.me/v1/bots/supporter-count/MyBotID" alt="support bots"/>&lt;/a>
            </code></pre>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              My Prime Bot ran out of Buidl Bots. How do I get more?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a Prime Bot has cloned enough Support bots, you'll gain access
            to the 'Metamorph' function in your Prime Bot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How does the Metamorph work?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a Prime Bot has been supported a sufficient number of times,
            the owner of the Prime Bot will be granted the 'Metamorph' function.
            A Metamorph will create a new generation of the Prime Bot (ex. Gen 0
            will become Gen 1). Metamorphing a Prime Bot will grant it another
            chance at picking up another rare mutation (previous rares carry on
            to the next generation). Once a Prime Bot has metamorphed, all new
            Buidl and Support Bot clones will be based on the new generation,
            and no more clones of the previous generation can be generated.
